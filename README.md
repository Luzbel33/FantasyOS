## 🎯 Current State (MVP)

This is a proof-of-concept with placeholder features. The floating orb currently shows basic app navigation - the vision is for it to function as a true Windows-style navbar with system controls and mystical AI integration.

The ultimate goal extends far beyond this MVP:

- **OpenRouter AI Integration** - Ancestral knowledge queries and mystical guidance

- **Enhanced Mysticism** - Deeper lore integration and interactive rituals
- **Audio System** - Ambient soundscapes and mystical audio feedback
- **UI Polish** - Remove AI artifacts, improve animations, add functional depth
- **AI Assistant** - Contextual help, knowledge delivery, and predictive insights
